=========================
Basic GIS using QGIS
=========================

This course introduces participants to Free and Open Source Geospatial tools.  
We will explore Quantum GIS as an easy to use FOSS-Geo application. The 
materials focus on the basic interface and data exploration of QGIS.

Quantum GIS (`QGIS <http://www.qgis.org/>`_) is a user friendly Open Source 
Geographic Information System (GIS) that runs on several operating systems 
(Linux, Unix, Mac OSX, and Windows). QGIS supports vector, raster, and database 
formats. QGIS is licensed under the GNU Public License.

**What you will learn**

At the end of the training/workshop, participants should be able to:

* install QGIS,
* navigate the basic interface of QGIS,
* transform paper-based maps into GIS formats,
* transform and create geospatial data from field reports and other non-map 
  based information,
* perform basic vector data processing and,
* prepare paper-based maps.
