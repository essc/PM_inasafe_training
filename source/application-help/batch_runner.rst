   Batch Runner

With this tool you can setup numerous scenarios and run them all in one go.
A typical use case may be where you define a number of e.g. flood impact
scenarios all using a standard dataset e.g. ``flood.shp``. As new flood data
becomes available you replace ``flood.shp`` and rerun the scenarios using the
batch runner. Using this approach you can quickly produce regional contingency
plans as your understanding of hazards changes. When you run the batch of
scenarios, pdf reports are generated automatically and all placed in a single
common directory making it easy for you to browse and disseminate the reports
produced.

When the batch process completes, it will also produce a summary report like
this::

    InaSAFE Batch Report File
    -----------------------------
    P: gempa bumi Sumatran fault (Mw7.8)
    P: gempa di Yogya tahun 2006
    P: banjir jakarta 2007
    P: Tsunami di Maumere (Mw 8.1)
    P: gempa Mw6.5 Palu-Koro Fault
    P: gunung merapi meletus
    -----------------------------
    Total passed: 6
    Total failed: 0
    Total tasks: 6
    -----------------------------


For advanced users there is also the ability to batch run python scripts using
this tool, but this should be considered an **experimental** feature still at
this stage.

Before running the Batch Runner you might want to use the
:ref:`tb_save_scenario` tool to first save some scenarios on which you
can let the batch runner do its work. This tool lets you run saved scenarios
in one go. It lets you select scenarios or let run all scenarios in one go.
