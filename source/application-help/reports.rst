Reports
=======

Reports about the impact scenario project are generated using QGIS composer
templates.
The default template is being shipped with the plugin,
but you can easily create your own templates in QGIS and use them as basis for
your reports.

Localized templates are supported via the following simple schema:

if there is a specified template called
:file:`/path/to/template/foo.qpt` then the plugin looks in the template
directory :file:`/path/to/template/` for a file called file
:file:`foo-LANG.qpt`, where "LANG" is the language code of the system locale.

If such a file exists it will be used for report creation,
otherwise the original template
:file:`/path/to/template/foo.qpt` will be used.

Report Template Elements
------------------------

A Template contains the next three groups of elements:

* **Static elements**.
* **Elements containing tokens for replacement**.
* **Elements that are directly updated by the renderer**.

Static Elements
...............

These are elements which are not changed during report generation, e.g. some
logos/images, additional texts, etc. You can safely remove such elements or
replace them with your own as needed.

Elements containing tokens for replacement
..........................................

In this case the element name is not significant, only the token(s) it
contains. At render time any of the tokens in these elements will be replaced
with translated content (if an alternative locale is in effect) from the
plugin according to the keywords listed below in this document.

Elements that are directly updated by the renderer
..................................................

In this case any content that may be present in the element is completely
replaced by the realtime map renderer, although certain styling options
(e.g. graticule settings on the map) will remain in effect.

This elements are recognized by their ID's and currently the plugin supports
the following elements:

* **safe-logo** --- QGIS composer image, which will be used for displaying
  organization logo. By default BNPB logo is used. To use custom logo image,
  set the path to your PNG file in the plugin Options dialog (see
  :ref:`toolbar_options` for details).
* **impact-map** --- QGIS composer map, which will be used for displaying the
  impact scenario.
* **impact-legend** --- QGIS composer legend, which will be used for displaying
  the legend of the impact scenario.

Replaceable Keywords
--------------------

This section describes tokenised keywords that are passed to the map template.
To insert any of these keywords into the map template, simply enclose the
key in [] (e.g. [place-name]) and it will be replaced by the text value (e.g.
Tondano). The list includes static phrases which have been internationalised
(and so they will be displayed in the language of the selected map local,
defaulting to English where no translation if available).

The following tokenized keywords are supported:

* **impact-title** --- title of the impact scenario map.
* **date** --- date of the assessment.
* **time** --- time of the assessment.
* **safe-version** --- version of the plugin used.

Custom templates
----------------

You have a few options to customise the template **without doing any
programming**. There are three primary ways you can achieve this:

* Moving replaceable keywords into different elements, or removing them
  completely.
* Changing template elements look and feel (e.g. setting up fonts, colors,
  borders, etc), moving the template elements themselves around or
  adding / removing them completely.
* Creating your own template from scratch and using it instead of default one.

The template is provided as
:file:`inasafe/safe_qgis/resources/qgis-composer-templates/inasafe.qpt`
and can be modified by opening the template using the QGIS map composer,
making your changes and then overwriting the template or saving it in any
directory.
You should take care to test your template changes before using it in
a production environment.

To use a custom template instead of the default one,
go to :menuselection:`Plugins --> InaSAFE --> InaSAFE Options` or click on
the InaSAFE plugin toolbar's options icon.
In Options dialog specify :guilabel:`Report template` setting.
It should contain full path to your custom template.
