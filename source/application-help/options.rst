Options
=======

The InaSAFE plugin provides an options dialog which allows you to
define various options relating to how InaSAFE will behave. The
options dialog can be launched by clicking on the InaSAFE plugin
toolbar's options icon (as shown below) or by doing
:menuselection:`Plugins --> InaSAFE --> InaSAFE Options`.

Then the dialog will appear, looking something like this:

.. note::

   You can click on the :guilabel:`Help` button at any time and it
   will open the help documentation browser to this page.

The following options are available on the :guilabel:`Options Dialog`:

* :guilabel:`Only show visible layers in the InaSAFE dock` : This option will
  determine whether **all** (when unchecked) hazard and impact layers should
  be listed in the InaSAFE dock's combo boxes. or (when checked) only
  visible layers.
* :guilabel:`Set QGIS layer name from 'title' in keywords` : This option will
  (when enabled) cause QGIS to name layers in the :guilabel:`Layers tree`
  using the `title` keyword in the layer's keywords file. If the layer
  has no 'title' in its keywords, or it has no keywords at all, the normal
  QGIS behaviour for naming layers will apply.
* :guilabel:`Zoom to impact layer on scenario estimate completion` : This
  option will cause the map view to zoom in/out in order to completely contain
  the InaSAFE impact scenario map output when an analysis completes.
* :guilabel:`Hide exposure layer on scenario estimate completion` : This
  option will cause QGIS to turn off the exposure layer used when
  InaSAFE completes the current analysis. You can re-enable the layer
  visibility again by checking its checkbox in the legend.
* :guilabel:`Clip datasets to visible extent before analysis` : This
  option will cause QGIS to clip hazard and exposure layers to the currently
  visible extent on the map canvas.
* :guilabel:`When clipping, also clip features (e.g. will clip polygon
  smaller)`: This option will any polygons that extend beyond the analysis
  extents to be clipped so that they are contained by the analysis extents.
  For example if you have a flood hazard polygon layer that extends far
  beyond your area of interest, the flood polygons will be reduced so that
  only the part inside of your area of interested is retained. This can
  speed up processing time somewhat.
* :guilabel:`Help to improve InaSAFE by submitting errors to a remote server` :
  This option, when enabled, will submit diagnostic information back to an
  InaSAFE project server in the event of any error taking place that
  we are able to trap. The information provided is useful to the
  InaSAFE team to improve the robustness of the software we produce
  and to spot trends in issues people encounter. Please note the warning text
  below this option which is included here in full:

.. note::
   The above setting requires a QGIS restart to disable/enable. Error
   messages and diagnostic information will be posted to
   http://sentry.linfiniti.com/inasafe-desktop/. Some institutions may not
   allow you to enable this feature - check with your network administrator
   if unsure. Although the data is submitted anonymously,
   the information contained in tracebacks may contain file system paths
   which reveal your identity or other information from your system.

* :guilabel:`Show intermediate layers generated by postprocessing` : This
  option will cause QGIS to show the intermediate files generated by the
  postprocessing steps in the map canvas.
* :guilabel:`Default female ratio` : This is the default female to total
  population ratio used por generating Gender breakdowns
* :guilabel:`Keyword cache for remote datasources` : This option is used to
  determine where keywords are stored for datasets where it is not possible
  to write them into a .keywords file. See :ref:`keywords_system` in the
  InaSAFE User-Manual for more information on the keywords system.
* :guilabel:`Logo for maps (must be x x y)`: This option is used to determine
  a custom logo that will be used in the pdf of your impact scenario project.
  See :ref:`toolbar_reports` in the InaSAFE User-Manual for more
  information on the reports. **NOTE**: image should have size X x Y.
* :guilabel:`Report template`: This option is used to determine a custom
  template that will be used for generating a pdf of your impact scenario
  project. See :ref:`toolbar_reports` in the InaSAFE User-Manual for
  more information on the reports.
* :guilabel:`Enable developer mode`. With this option enabled,
  you can right click on the report area and use the webkit debug tools to
  debug the output. **This option is intended for advanced users only.**


.. note:: Pressing :guilabel:`Cancel` at any time will close the options
   dialog and any changes made will **not** be applied.
   Pressing :guilabel:`OK` at any time will close the options dialog and any
   changes made **will** be applied immediately.

.. note:: The exact button order shown on this dialog may differ depending on
   your operating system or desktop environment.
