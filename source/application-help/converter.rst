=========

Shakemaps are useful for carrying out contingency planning for the event of an
earthquake. Normally these are distributed as grid.xml files which are not
usable in InaSAFE or QGIS. This tool will import a grid.xml file as a
GEOTIFF file from where it can be used within InaSAFE.

Two different interpolation algorithms can be used during the import process -
``Nearest Neighbour`` and ``Inverse Distance``. After the conversion, the tool
automatically creates InaSAFE keyword metadata for the layer so that
it can be used immediately for analysis.

To use this tool effectively:

 * Select a grid.xml for the input layer.
 * Choose where to write the output layer to.
 * Choose the interpolation algorithm that should be used when converting the
   xml grid to a raster. If unsure keep the default.

You can obtain shake data for free from the `USGS
shakemap site <http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/shakemap/list.php?y=2013>`_.

If you download the grid file, you should right-click on it and choose
:menuselection:`Save as` in order to ensure that it is saved properly. OSX and
Linux users may also consider using command line tools to fetch the grid file:

OSX::

   curl -O http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/shakemap/global/shake/<shake id>/download/grid.xml

Linux::

   wget -C http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/shakemap/global/shake/<shake id>/download/grid.xml

.. note:: Replace the <shake id> in the commands above with the actual shake id.
